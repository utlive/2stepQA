=================================================================

The current release implements 2stepQA, an efficient image quality reduced-reference predictor. 2stepQA integrates both no-reference (NR) and full-reference perceptual quality measurements into the quality prediction process.The no-reference module accounts for the possibly imperfect quality of the source (reference) image, while the full-reference component measures the quality differences between the source image and its possibly further distorted version. A simple, yet very efficient, multiplication step fuses the two sources of information into a reliable objective prediction score.
The current release contains example images for testing.
